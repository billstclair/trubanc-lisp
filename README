I have renamed Trubanc to Truledger (http://truledger.com/).

The name change removes the words "banc" and "bank" from the web site, code, and protocol. This means that Trubanc clients are not compatible with Truledger servers. It also means that existing Trubanc databases have to be updated to work with the new Truledger code. Contact me (bill at billstclair dot com) if you need help with that conversion.
